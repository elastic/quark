Quark Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  This file documents breaking and/or other changes that might require
  user interaction. Examples include: a user facing structure change; a
  new library call; a change in behaviour.

Changes from 0.1 to 0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  o quark_queue_stats{} got a "backend" member.

Changes from 0.2 to 0.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  o quark_queue_process{} got {uts,ipc,mnt,net}_inonum members.
  o -h on quark-{mon,test,btf} now invokes the manpage instead of usage.

Changes from 0.3 to 0.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  o quark_queue_get_events(3) was removed in favor of quark_queue_get_event(3).
  o quark_event{} got a new member socket,
    QUARK_EV_SOCK_CONN_{ESTABLISHED,CLOSED}. The probes still have
    some issues so it's mostly experimental.
