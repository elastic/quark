Quark Breaking Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  This file documents breaking and/or other changes that might require
  user interaction. Examples include: a user facing structure change; a
  new library call; a change in behaviour.

Changes from 0.1 to 0.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  o quark_queue_stats{} got a "backend" member.

Changes from 0.2 to 0.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  o quark_queue_process{} got {uts,ipc,mnt,net}_inonum members.
  o -h on quark-{mon,test,btf} now invokes the manpage instead of usage.

Changes from 0.3 to 0.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  o quark_queue_get_events(3) was removed in favor of quark_queue_get_event(3).
  o quark_event{} got a new member socket,
    QUARK_EV_SOCK_CONN_{ESTABLISHED,CLOSED}. The probes still have
    some issues so it's mostly experimental.
  o Initial snapshot of process events is not sent anymore. User is
    expected to retrieve them via quark_process_iter(3) if
    desired. QUARK_EV_SNAPHOT and QQ_NO_SNAPSHOT
  o QUARK_EV_SNAPSHOT and QQ_NO_SNAPSHOT are gone.
  o quark_event{} got a cgroup field guarded by QUARK_F_CGROUP.
  o cmdline arguments are now handled via quark_cmdline_iter{} and friends.
  o DNS events were added via QQ_DNS and expressed via quark_packet{}
    in the packet member of quark_event{}.
  o quark-mon(8) got options for socket and dns events: -S and -N.
  o QQ_BYPASS was added for ebpf, with this a client can choose to use
    quark just as bpf loader and access the ring directly. The ring
    event is in quark_event.bypass.
  o Quark can now be linked against system libraries instead of
    embedding its own libbpf and zlib, via make SYSLIB=y.
