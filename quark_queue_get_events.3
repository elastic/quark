.Sh NAME
.Nm quark_queue_get_events
.Nd main quark driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In quark.h
.Ft int
.Fn quark_queue_get_events "struct quark_queue *qq" "struct quark_event *qev" "int nqev"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
fills the array of events pointed to by
.Fa qev
to a maximum of
.Fa neqv
entries.
.Pp
This function is the main driver of quark.
Quark doesn't create threads or introduces hidden control flows, all its state
is mutated through this function call.
For a better explanation of quark's design, refer to
.Xr quark 7 .
A summary of what this function does:
.Bl -bullet
.It
Populates its priority queue with raw events by calling into the backend
populate function.
.It
Attempts to collect raw events that are deemed old enough from its priority
queue, if successfull tries to aggregate such events.
.It
Converts the collected raw events into proper
.Vt quark_events .
This involves consulting its internal cache and enriching said events.
These
.Vt quark_events
are then passed to the user via
.Fa qev .
.It
Garbage collects cached events that are marked for deletion and are old enough.
When a process exits, its event cache is marked for deletion, but a grace time
is given before purging it so that the user might still query it for some time.
.El
.Pp
A
.Vt quark_event
is defined as:
.Bd -literal
struct quark_event {
	u64				 events;
	const struct quark_process	*process;
};
.Ed
.Bl -tag -width "events"
.It Em events
A bitmask representing the events that originated this
.Vt quark_event :
.Bl -tag -width "QUARK_EV_SETPROCTITLE" -compact
.It Dv QUARK_EV_FORK
New process, result of a fork.
.It Dv QUARK_EV_EXEC
Process changed image, result of an exec.
.It Dv QUARK_EV_EXIT
Process exited.
.It Dv QUARK_EV_SETPROCTITLE
Process changed its name (COMM).
.El
.Pp
It's important to note that
.Em events
is what triggered the event, not what is known about the process.
.Pp
It might also be more than one value as events get
aggregated.
For example, a short lived process will have the following mask:
.Dv QUARK_EV_FORK | QUARK_EV_EXEC | QUARK_EV_EXIT .
.It Em process
A pointer to the process which originated the event.
.Vt struct quark_process
is defined as:
.Bd -literal
struct quark_process {
	u32	pid;
	u64	flags;
	/* QUARK_F_PROC */
	u64	proc_cap_inheritable;
	u64	proc_cap_permitted;

	char	cmdline[1024];
	/* QUARK_F_CWD */
	char	cwd[1024];
};
.Ed
.Pp
.Em flags
represent the fields which are known about the process, these can be
cached and originate from previous events.
Each bit in the set represents one or more members of the structure, if the bit
is unset, the respective members are invalid/unknown.
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "QUARK_F_FILENAME" -compact
.It Dv QUARK_F_PROC
.Em proc_
members are valid.
.It Dv QUARK_F_EXIT
.Em exit_code
is valid.
.It Dv QUARK_F_COMM
.Em comm
is valid.
.It Dv QUARK_F_FILENAME
.Em filename
is valid.
.It Dv QUARK_F_CMDLINE
.Em cmdline
and
.Em cmdline_len
are valid.
.It Dv QUARK_F_CWD
.Em cwd
is valid.
.El
.El
.Sh MEMORY PROTOCOL
.Em process
points to internal data, it
.Em MUST NOT
be modified and/or stored.
In the case of multithreading, the pointer should not be accessed concurrently
with another thread which executes
.Nm .
.Pp
In other words, read the stuff you want, copy it out, and forget about it.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The number of filled events via
.Fa qev
to a maximum of
.Fa nqev .
If zero is returned, the user should consider calling
.Xr quark_queue_block 3 .
In the case of an internal error, -1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set.
