.Sh NAME
.Nm quark-mon
.Nd monitor and print quark events
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm quark-mon
.Op Fl bDekstv
.Op Fl C Ar filename
.Op Fl l Ar maxlength
.Op Fl m Ar maxnodes
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program listens to all incoming
.Xr quark 7
events and prints them to stdout, the output format used is the one in
.Xr quark_event_dump 3 .
.Pp
The main utility is for testing and debugging quark, it's also a good
introduction to the code base.
.Nm
runs until a SIGINT is received.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Dtb
.It Fl b
Attempt EBPF as the backend.
.It Fl C Ar filename
Dumps the contents of the internal cache into
.Ar filename
after exit.
Format is a
.Em dot
file that can be compiled to a
.Em svg
with:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dot -Tsvg filename -o filename.svg
.Ed
.It Fl D
Drop priviledges to nobody and chroot to /var/empty, useful to show how quark
can run without priviledges.
.It Fl e
Include
.Em proc_entry_leader
and
.Em proc_entry_type
in
.Em quark_events .
Entry leader is how the process entered the system, it is disabled by default as
it is Elastic/ECS specific.
.It Fl g
Use minimal aggregation, fork, exec and exit will
.Em not
be aggregated.
.It Fl k
Attempt kprobe as the backend.
.It Fl l Ar maxlength
Maximum lenght of the quark queue, essentially how much quark is willing to
buffer, refer to
.Xr quark_queue_open 3
for further details.
.It Fl s
Don't send the initial snapshot of existing processes.
.It Fl t
Don't supress thread events, this is only useful for debugging and will likely
be zapped in the future.
.It Fl v
Increase verbosity, can be specified multiple times for more verbosity.
.It Fl m Ar maxnodes
Don't really process events, just collect
.Ar maxnodes
in the sorting tree
and output
.Pa quark_by_time.dot
and
.Pa quark_by_pidtime.dot .
The first is events sorted by time, and the second by pid plus time.
Exits after
.Ar maxnodes
has been reached.
This is used purely for internal debugging.
.El
.Sh BACKEND SELECTION
If no backend option is specified,
.Nm
will attempt EBPF, and then kprobe if EBPF failed.
If only one of
.Fl b
or
.Fl k
is passed, then
.Nm
will be restricted to that option only.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Nm
exits with 0 in if a SIGINT was sent, or 1 in case of error.
